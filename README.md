# SODAQ boards

These are the files to integrate the SODAQ boards into the Arduino Boards
Manager.  As of Arduino IDE version 1.6.4 you can add them at File >
Preferences > Additional Boards Manager URLs.  Add the following URL
`http://downloads.sodaq.net/package_sodaq_index.json`

In this package we have the following boards
* SODAQ Autonomo
* SODAQ Mbili
* SODAQ Ndogo
* SODAQ Tatu
* SODAQ Moja (obsolete, just added for completeness)

# Directory Structure

There are two major directory trees. One for AVR boards and one for SAMD
boards.  Each have their own versioning scheme.
